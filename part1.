# What was wrong in the original code?

1. Missing field checks
2. SKU uniqueness not checked
3. Two separate database commits
4. No error handling
5. No data type validation

# What I fixed?
- Added required field validation
- Checked for duplicate SKU
- Used one transaction (one commit)
- Added error handling with rollback
- Converted price to float safely
