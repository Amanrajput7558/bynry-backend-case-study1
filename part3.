# Part 3: Low Stock Alerts API

# Goal:
To return all products for a company that have low stock in any warehouse.


# Assumptions:
- Threshold for low stock is set to 20 (can be dynamic in real implementation)
- Recent sales check is assumed to be always true
- Supplier info is connected through a many-to-many relationship
- Days until stockout is a placeholder value (12)


# Logic:
1. Get all warehouses for the company
2. For each warehouse, check all product inventories
3. If current stock < threshold â†’ add to alerts list
4. Attach supplier info from `supplier_products` mapping
5. Return final alert list as JSON
