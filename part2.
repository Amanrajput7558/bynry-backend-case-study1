# Missing Information

1. Where to store product's low stock threshold?
2. How to track recent sales for each product?
3. What defines if a product is a bundle or not?
4. Do products have categories or types?
5. Should inventory changes be versioned or logged?

# Design Decisions:
- Used `companies` and `warehouses` with foreign key relationship.
- Used `products` with a `is_bundle` flag.
- Inventory is linked to product and warehouse, and includes quantity and timestamp.
- Supplier and product have many-to-many relation through `supplier_products` table.
- Bundles are handled in a separate table with quantity of each component.
